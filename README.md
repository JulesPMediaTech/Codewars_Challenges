# My Codewar Challenges

https://www.codewars.com/

Code wars is addictive! It's kind of like Wordle or Sudoku. I like to do one (or two) of them a day to keep my programming problem solving skills honed.

My philosophy is to try to not use any imported libraries UNLESS the challenge requires it. So just using the base Python functions and keywords.

So here are a few of my solutions.

Confession! In some cases, I've added a second method of someone else's if it's a solution I think is particularly nifty!

Unless otherwise commented in the files, I'm using `Python 3.12.3`
